# stable-diffusion-api
This repository contains a Flask-based API for generating images using Stable Diffusion. It allows users to send a text prompt via an HTTP request and receive an AI-generated image in response. The model is powered by diffusers from Hugging Face and runs on CUDA (GPU) or CPU, ensuring efficient text-to-image generation.
